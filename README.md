#### Mindset
- Do each problem as if you are in an interview.
- ~20 minutes to read and solve problem.
- Whiteboard it out, explain thought process.
- Only begin coding once you have a understandable solution.
- When you read a problem. You should instantly cross out data structures and algorithms that 100% couldn't solve the problem.
- You should also think, "how could X data structure or pattern solve this?"
- If you absolutely cannot solve it after 5-10 minutes, look at the solution and gain some intuition on what the trick was.
- Keep an eye out for "off by one" errors.
