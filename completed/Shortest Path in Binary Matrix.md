#### Problem
Given an `n x n` binary matrix `grid`, return _the length of the shortest **clear path** in the matrix_. If there is no clear path, return `-1`.

A **clear path** in a binary matrix is a path from the **top-left** cell (i.e., `(0, 0)`) to the **bottom-right** cell (i.e., `(n - 1, n - 1)`) such that:

- All the visited cells of the path are `0`.
- All the adjacent cells of the path are **8-directionally** connected (i.e., they are different and they share an edge or a corner).

The **length of a clear path** is the number of visited cells of this path.

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** grid = [[0,1],[1,0]]
**Output:** 2

#### Notes
---
Basically just BFS in all 8 directions. Watch out for edge cases like when the starting or ending cell is `1` which means you cannot find a path.

Use a visited matrix to keep track of visited cells.

Make sure to do bounds checks and make sure you don't get your rows and columns mixed up.

class Solution:
    def shortestPathBinaryMatrix(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        N, M = len(grid), len(grid[0]) # N=ROWS, M=COLS
        if grid[0][0] != 0 or grid[N-1][M-1] != 0:
            return -1
        q = deque([])
        q.append((0, 0, 1))
        target = (N-1, M-1)
        # Init the visited array
        visited = [[False] * M for _ in range(N)]
        visited[0][0] = True

        while q:
            x, y, path = q.popleft()
            if (x, y) == target:
                return path
            for dx, dy in [
                (0, 1),   # right

                nx, ny = x+dx, y+dy
                if (
                    0 <= nx < N and 
                    0 <= ny < M and
                    not visited[nx][ny] and
                    grid[nx][ny] == 0
                ):
                    visited[nx][ny] = True
                    q.append((nx, ny, path + 1))
        return -1
