- "How could I make the insight that leads to discovering the solution?" is just as important as "What is the solution?"
- Focus on strengthening your "intuition" on which algorithm a problem needs.
- Metacognition is the idea of "thinking about thinking".
	- Think about why you chose a particular strategy.
	- Ask: "Where did I get stuck?"
	- Realizations or "Aha" moments.
- Ways to rapidly improve your intuition
	- Look at a bunch of problems, and immediately look at their solutions and pick up on the common patterns that you see.
	- Read a bunch of problems and quiz yourself to see if your intuition is correct.
- Things to keep in mind:
	- Can I solve this by sorting it?
	- Will reversing it help?
	- Will starting from the end of the list help?
- For sliding window:
	- It's typically a question of a smaller thing within a bigger thing
		- Ex: Substring without repeating characters
- For two pointers:
	- It's typically a sorted problem, or needs to be sorted to then use two pointers.
