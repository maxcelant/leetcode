#### Weaknesses
- Focus on mapping out the problem.
- Edge cases.
- Implementations.
- Need to focus on hammering reversing a linked listâ€”this should be a cake walk.
- Should also get comfortable with merging two linked lists together.
- Recursion with trees and graphs, need to grok this and get really good at it.
#### Strengths
- Getting better at thinking of a solid approach to a problem.
- Improving at seeing common patterns.
