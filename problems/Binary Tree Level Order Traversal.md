#### Intuition
---
_"How could I make the insight that leads to discovering the solution?"_
- Use BFS since we need the nodes a layer at a time.
- We need to store the nodes from each layer somewhereâ€”a hash map makes sense.

#### Code
---

```python
class Solution:
    def levelOrder(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[List[int]]:
        if not root: return []
        layers = defaultdict(list)
        q = deque([(root, 1)]) # node, layer
        while q:
            node, layer = q.popleft()
            layers[layer].append(node.val)
            if node.left:
                q.append((node.left, layer + 1))
            if node.right:
                q.append((node.right, layer + 1))
        return [v for v in layers.values()] 
```

#### Insight  
---
_"What are the important aspects of the solution?"_
- Since we need the nodes for each layer, we can use a dict of `layer: list of nodes`.
- We simply add 1 from the previous layer when we dequeue.
- We concat the lists at the end from the dict.
