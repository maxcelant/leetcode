#### Intuition
- Use a `dummy` node to handle edge cases like removing the first node from the list, or in situations where there is just one node in the linked list.
- Use recursion + cache if you need to build a new linked list from an existing one.

#### Advice
- Get comfortable with reversing a linked list iteratively.
- Use iteration if possible, it's simpler in most cases.
- Use [[Floyd's Tortoise and Hare]] to locate cycles.
