#### Approach
---
- If the value is larger than the right-most value in a column, increment column by 1
- If the value is smaller than the left-most value in a column, decrement column by 1.
- If the value is within the confines of this row, use binary search to find it.

#### Code

```python

class Solution:
    def searchMatrix(self, matrix: List[List[int]], target: int) -> bool:
        

```
