### Sliding Window vs Two Pointers?
- Use two pointers for:
  - **Data Types**: Sorted arrays, linked lists.
  - **Element Selection** Not neighboring elements
  - Commonly used to find pairs/triplets with a specific sum.
  - Usually pointers start at opposite ends.
- Use sliding window for:
  - **Data Types**: Arrays or strings
  - **Element Selection** Neighboring elements 
  - Dealing with neighboring elements in arrays/substrings.
  - Used to find the max/min sums, lengths and counts within a subarray.

```python
print('hello')
```
