- "How could I make the insight that leads to discovering the solution?" is just as important as "What is the solution?"
- Focus on strengthening your "intuition" on which algorithm a problem needs.
- Things to keep in mind:
	- Can I solve this by sorting it?
	- Will reversing it help?
	- Will starting from the end of the list help?
- For sliding window:
	- It's typically a question of a smaller thing within a bigger thing
		- Ex: Substring without repeating characters
- For two pointers:
	- It's typically a sorted problem, or needs to be sorted to then use two pointers.
